# SharpsSteer

SharpSteer is a C# port of OpenSteer. Like OpenSteer, the aim of SharpSteer is to help construct steering behaviors for autonomous characters in games and animation, with a current implementation focus toward Microsoft's XNA.

Like [OpenSteer](http://opensteer.sourceforge.net/), SharpSteer provides a XNA-based application which demonstrates predefined steering behaviors. The user can quickly prototype, visualize, annotate and debug new steering behaviors by writing a plug-in for this Demo application.
